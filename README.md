# Shortest Path Finder (Java)

This project is a Java-based graph traversal application developed as part of
an academic coursework project.

## Description
The program models a graph using an adjacency matrix and explores paths
between nodes using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. The main focus of
the project is understanding graph representation, traversal logic, and
algorithmic problem solving.

## Key Features
- Depth-First Search (DFS) implementation in Java
- Adjacency matrix representation of graphs
- Custom data structures for graph handling
- Emphasis on algorithm correctness and traversal logic

## Technologies
- Java

## Notes
This is an academic group project. I contributed to the implementation of
DFS logic, testing of the standard DFS algorithm and its traversal logic and algorithm testing.
